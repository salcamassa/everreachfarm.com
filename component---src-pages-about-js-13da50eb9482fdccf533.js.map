My name is Katelyn and I am the farmer-owner of Ever Reach Farm located in Pittsboro, NC. We are a relatively new farm, having started this summer, but are no strangers to the growing, cooking, and sharing of produce. I have spent the past 3 years working on other farms in the area learning the tricks of the trade and what the responsibility of being a farmer means to myself, the environment, and most importantly the community surrounding me. Since attending NC State for Agriculture, I found Chatham County to be a real jewel in the pocket of a small NC town--it has such strong community ties and a true appreciation for people and farming. Although I didnâ€™t grow up here, I feel so ingrained in the community and the welcoming nature of learning and sharing with one another. This aspect of community, coupled with a passion for working in synchrony with the environment is the meaning behind what I do as a farmer. I also find immense joy in cooking and sharing the bounty, which is why I work to create a balance between farming and adding value to my products that I hope people will appreciate.</p>\n      </Col>\n    </Row>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default AboutPage\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
